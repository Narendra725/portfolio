                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>My journey started with SQL and data analysis, where I built a strong foundation working with Oracle SQL and large datasets. This helped me understand how data is structured, queried, and optimized for real business use cases.

I then moved into business intelligence, working extensively with Power BI—building reports, writing DAX measures, and focusing on performance and usability. This phase taught me how to turn raw data into clear, meaningful insights for end users.

More recently, I’ve been working with Microsoft Fabric, gaining experience with Warehouses, Lakehouses, SQL endpoints, and semantic models. This allowed me to think beyond individual reports and focus on end-to-end data solutions, from data modeling to analytics delivery.

Alongside BI and SQL, I use Python for data processing and automation, which helps me approach problems programmatically. Today, I work at the intersection of data, analytics, and modern data platforms, continuously learning and building solutions that are efficient, scalable, and practical.</p>
